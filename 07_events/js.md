# Javascript:
    (default js behavior )
    1) Synchronous  => executing one by one
    2) Single threaded => only one thread in js for executing

# Execution context: -->
    exectue one line of code at a time
    > console.log - 1
    > console.log - 2

    CALL STACK      MEMORY HEAP

    (Each operation waits for execute the last one to complete brfore exacuting)


# Blocking code-----------------Vs-------------------non Blocking code
    
    > Block the flow of code exectution               > Do not block execution
   
    > Read file Sync                                  > Read file Async

    - Both is sutaible because Every thing is a use case.
